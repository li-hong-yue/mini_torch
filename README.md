# mini_torch

A minimal NumPy-based deep learning framework designed for **educational purposes**.  
It provides autograd, basic modules, optimizers, and commonly used activation and loss functions.

---

## Features

- **Tensor class**: with autograd support 
- **Module class**: `Linear` 
- **Activation functions**: `sigmoid`, `relu`, `tanh`, `softmax`  
- **Loss functions**: `cross_entropy`  
- **Optimizers**: `SGD`, `Adam`

## TODO

The framework is minimal and currently lacks several features available in full-fledged deep learning libraries like PyTorch:

- Convolutional layers (e.g., `Conv2d`)  
- GPU/accelerated computations
